# CICERO: A Domain-Specific Architecture for Efficient Regular Expression Matching [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13340217.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13340217)

Cicero is a domain specific architecture that can be employed to perform exact regular expression (RE) matching using FPGAs.
The cool fact about Cicero is that - as other software libraries one among the other [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2) - does not suffer from backtracking problem.
This means that when it elaborate a REs that carry some kind of non-determinsm (e.,g. a?a ) it does not take a guess and then backtrack but can explore all the different options in a single pass of the input string.

If you are interested in the topic take a look at [Russ Cox article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html).

## System View

From a system perspective, Cicero features two components:

1. **A compiler**: which compiles REs into a domain specific ISA binary
2. **An architecture on FPGA**: which receives a compiled RE and an input string, and output wheter the input is matched by the RE or not.

## Compiler Overview

The compiler's code can be found [here](https://github.com/necst/cicero_compiler_cpp). The compiler is implemented using MLIR and ANTLR4. The compilation pipeline can be described as follows:

1. Parse textual RE into ANTLR4 AST
2. Generate representation of Regex using the proposed `regex` MLIR dialect
3. (optional) Optimization pass on `regex` dialect
4. Lowering conversion of `regex` dialect to proposed `cicero` dialect
5. (optional) Optimization pass on `cicero` dialect
6. Generate Cicero ISA binary code

## Architecture Overview

![cicero-engine](./figures/cicero-engine.png)

The Cicero architecture features a sliding window of input characters. Each character in the window is addressed by a `CC_ID_BITS`-bits wide pointer, as such the window contains `2^CC_ID_BITS` characters.
The Cicero architecture is composed of multiple *engines*, which can be combined together in ring or torus topologies. Execution threads are distributed among engines by a load balancing infrastructure. However, during our studies we found out that an architecture configuration with a single engine is more efficient.
Each engine packs as many FIFOs and CICERO-cores as number of characters in the input window.

## Code Overview

- `bitstream`: pre-compiled bitstreams for Ultra96 v2 board, and their static metrics (board usage percentages and total on-chip power)
- `cicero_compiler`: older compiler implementation
- `cicero_compiler_cpp`: new compiler implementation, using MLIR
- `hdl_src`: System Verilog implementation of the architecture
- `proj`: Vivado project files for the architecture development
- `scripts`: Various helper scripts for development, verification and benchmarking
